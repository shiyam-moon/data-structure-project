Data structures , their areas of application and reasons for their use.

1.Linear data structures
•	Arrays
Applications;
•	For storing contacts in a phone,tabular  data ,cpu scheduling and as a foundation for other data structures .
Reasons why they are used;
•	Offer fast ,constant-time access to elements via index
•	Are cache friendly due to contiguous memory allocation

•	Linked list 
Applications;
•	Implimenting playlists in music players(next/previous song).browser history(back/forward),and managing free memory blocks in operating systems
Reasons why it is used
•	They allow efficient ,dynamic,insertion and deletion of elements without shifting entire data sets as they do not require contiguous memory.
Stacks(LIFO-Last In,First Out)
Applications;
Undo operations in text editors,browser history,parsing expressions in compilers and function calls.
Reasons why they are used
They are ideal for reversing data and backtracking,as only the top element is accessible.
Queues(FIFO-First In , First Out)
Applications;
Operating system task scheduling,handling website traffic , printer spooling,and buffering.
Reasons why it is used
They ensure fair ordered processing where the first data item to arrive is handled first.

NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
Trees
Applications;
File systems on computers(directories),DNS (Domain Name System),B-Tree/B+ Trees for database indexing ,and decision-making in machine learning.
Reasons why it is used 
They represent hierarchical relationships and allow fast searching,insertion,and deletion.

Graphs
Applications;
Social networks(Facebook/LinkedIn connections),GPS navigation systems (mapping paths),and routing algorithms in networking
Reasons why it is used
They are the best structure for modelling complex,interconnected reletionships and representing computation flow.
